2. **Connect Your Wallet**:
   - Send `/start` to the bot
   - Click the "Connect Your Payman Wallet" button
   - Complete the OAuth flow to grant access to your wallet
3. **View the Current Problem**:
   - Send `/problem` to see the active challenge
   - Note the current prize pool and attempt cost
4. **Make an Attempt**:
   - Send your answer as a message
   - If incorrect, the attempt cost will be charged to your wallet
   - The prize pool increases with each attempt
5. **Check Your Balance**:
   - Send `/balance` to view your wallet balance
6. **Win the Prize**:

## üìä Cost Structure

The attempt cost increases over time using a mathematical formula based on the Golden Ratio (œÜ) and Euler's number (e):

cost = base_cost * œÜ^(hours/6) * (1 + e^(hours/72)/10)


This creates an elegant progression:
- Hour 0-6: $0.50 - $0.81
- Hour 6-12: $0.81 - $1.31
- Hour 12-18: $1.31 - $2.12
- Hour 18-24: $2.12 - $3.43
- Hour 24+: Exponential growth
